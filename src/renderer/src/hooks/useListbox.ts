/**
 * The keyboard half of the WAI-ARIA listbox pattern, for a button that opens a
 * panel of options.
 *
 * Focus stays on the trigger the whole time and the highlighted option is announced
 * through `aria-activedescendant`, which is what lets the options be plain
 * `<li role="option">` rather than buttons: `role="option"` has to be a direct child
 * of the listbox, so any element that can hold DOM focus in between makes the
 * structure invalid. CommandPalette got this right first and had the only correct
 * keyboard handling in the app; this is that pattern with the search box taken out.
 *
 * Arrows, Home and End move; Enter and Space commit; a printable key jumps to the
 * next option starting with what has been typed, and one letter pressed repeatedly
 * cycles the options beginning with it the way a native <select> does. Escape and
 * outside-dismissal are deliberately not here: `usePopover` owns both for every
 * popover in the app.
 *
 * Ported alongside core's `use-listbox`, with the same signature, so the two stay
 * diffable until one of them moves to haus. The tests live in core, which has a
 * jsdom project; this repo's suite is node-only.
